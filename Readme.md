# DiceRoller

This is the final challenge project of 100 Days of SwiftUI by Paul Hudson (link [here](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/guide/ios-swiftui/7/3/challenge)). The project is an app that helps users roll dice then store the results they had.

As with all other challenges, there will be no extra tasks as the end of the challenge.
